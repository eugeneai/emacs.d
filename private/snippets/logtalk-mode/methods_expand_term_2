expand_term(?term, ?term)

Description
Expands a term. The most common use is to expand a grammar rule into a clause. Users may override the default Logtalk grammar rule translator by defining clauses for the term_expansion/2 hook predicate.

# prefix: expand_term
# --
expand_term(${1:Term}, ${2:Expansion})$0
