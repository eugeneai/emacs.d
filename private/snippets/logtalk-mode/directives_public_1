Description
Declares public predicates, public grammar rule non-terminals, and public operators. A public predicate can be called from any object. A public non-terminal can be used as an argument in phrase/2 and phrase/3 calls from any object. Public operators are not exported but declaring them provides useful information for defining client objects.
