Description
Declares that all calls made from predicates (or non-terminals) defined in the category or object containing the directive to the specified predicates (or non-terminals) are to be interpreted as messages to the specified object. Thus, this directive may be used to simplify writing of predicate definitions by allowing the programmer to omit the Object:: prefix when using the predicates listed in the directive (as long as the  calls do not occur as arguments for non-standard Prolog meta-predicates not declared on the adapter files). It is also possible to include operator declarations, op(Precedence, Associativity, Operator), in the second argument.
