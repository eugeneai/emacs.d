Description
True when the GrammarRuleBody grammar rule body can be applied to the Input list of tokens. In the most common case, GrammarRuleBody is a non-terminal defined by a grammar rule. This built-in method is declared private and thus cannot be used as a message to an object. When using a back-end Prolog compiler supporting a module system, calls in the format phrase(Module:GrammarRuleBody, Input) may also be used.
