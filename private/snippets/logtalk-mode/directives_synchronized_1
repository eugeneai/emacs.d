synchronized(+non_terminal_indicator_term)

Description
Declares synchronized predicates and synchronized grammar rule non-terminals. A synchronized predicate (or synchronized non-terminal) is protected by a mutex in order to allow for thread synchronization when proving a call to the predicate (or non-terminal). All predicates (and non-terminals) declared in the same synchronized directive share the same mutex. In order to use a separate mutex for each predicate (non-terminal) so that they are independently synchronized, a per-predicate synchronized directive must be used.
