current_predicate(?predicate_indicator)

Description
Enumerates, by backtracking, visible user predicates. When the predicate is declared in a uses/2 or use_module/2 directive, predicates are enumerated for the referenced object or module. Otherwise predicates are enumerated for an object. In the case of objects, predicates not declared using a scope directive are not enumerated.
