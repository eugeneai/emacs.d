goal_expansion(+callable, -callable)

Description
Defines an expansion for a goal. The first argument is the goal to be expanded. The expanded goal is returned in the second argument. This predicate is called recursively on the expanded goal until a fixed point is reached. Thus, care must be taken to avoid compilation loops. This predicate, when defined and within scope, is automatically called by the expand_goal/2 method. Use of this predicate by the expand_goal/2 method may be restricted by changing its default public scope.
