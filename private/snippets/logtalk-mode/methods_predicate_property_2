predicate_property(+callable, ?predicate_property)

Description
Enumerates, by backtracking, the properties of a visible predicate. When the predicate indicator for Predicate is declared in a uses/2 or use_module/2 directive, properties are enumerated for the referenced object or module predicate. Otherwise properties are enumerated for an object predicate. In the case of objects, properties for predicates not declared using a scope directive are not enumerated. The valid predicate properties are listed in the language grammar.
