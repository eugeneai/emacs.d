retract(+clause)

Description
Retracts a clause for a dynamic predicate. When the predicate indicator for Head is declared in a uses/2 or use_module/2 directive, the clause is retracted in the referenced object or module. Otherwise the clause is retracted in an object's dynamic predicate. On backtracking, the predicate retracts the next matching clause.
