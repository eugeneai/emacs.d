Description
User-defined non-terminal hook used to rewrite a message term into a list of tokens and declared in the logtalk built-in object as a public, multifile, and dynamic non-terminal. The list of tokens can be printed by calling the print_message_tokens/3 method. This non-terminal hook is automatically called by the print_message/3 method.
