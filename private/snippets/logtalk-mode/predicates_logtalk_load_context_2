logtalk_load_context(?atom, -nonvar)

Description
Provides access to the Logtalk compilation/loading context. The following keys are currently supported: entity_identifier, entity_prefix, entity_type (returns the value module when compiling a module as an object), source, file (the actual file being compiled, which is different from source only when processing an include/1 directive), basename, directory, stream, target (the full path of the intermediate Prolog file), flags (the list of the explicit flags used for the compilation of the source file), term (the term being expanded), term_position (StartLine-EndLine), and variable_names ([Name1=Variable1, ...]). The term_position key is only supported in back-end Prolog compilers that provide access to the start and end lines of a read term.
