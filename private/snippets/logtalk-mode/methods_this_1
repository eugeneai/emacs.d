this(?object_identifier)

Description
Unifies its argument with the identifier of the object for which the predicate clause whose body is being executed is defined (or the object importing the category that contains the predicate clause). This private method is implemented as a unification between its argument and the corresponding implicit execution-context argument in the predicate containing the call. This unification occurs at the clause head when the argument is not instantiated (the most common case). This method is useful for avoiding hard-coding references to an object identifier or for retrieving all object parameters with a single call when using parametric objects. See also parameter/2.
