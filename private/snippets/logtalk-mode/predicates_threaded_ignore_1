threaded_ignore(@callable)

Description
Proves Goal asynchronously using a new thread. Only the first goal solution is found. The argument can be a message sending goal. This call always succeeds, independently of the result (success, failure, or exception), which is simply discarded instead of being sent back to the message queue of the object containing the call (this).
