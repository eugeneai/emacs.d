encoding(+atom)

Description
Declares the source file text encoding. This is an experimental source file directive, which is only supported on some back-end Prolog compilers. When used, this directive must be the first term in the source file in the first line. Currently recognized encodings values include 'US-ASCII', 'ISO-8859-1', 'ISO-8859-2', 'ISO-8859-15', 'UCS-2', 'UCS-2LE', 'UCS-2BE', 'UTF-8', 'UTF-16', 'UTF-16LE', 'UTF-16BE', 'UTF-32', 'UTF-32LE', 'UTF-32BE', 'Shift_JIS', and 'EUC-JP'. Be sure to use an encoding supported by the chosen back-end Prolog compiler (whose adapter file must define a table that translates between the Logtalk and Prolog-specific atoms that represent each supported encoding). When writing portable code that cannot be expressed using ASCII, 'UTF-8' is usually the best choice.
