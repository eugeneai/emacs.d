term_expansion(+nonvar, -nonvar)
term_expansion(+nonvar, -list(nonvar))

Description
Defines an expansion for a term. This predicate, when defined and within scope, is automatically called by the expand_term/2 method. When that is not the case, the expand_term/2 method only uses the default expansions. Use of this predicate by the expand_term/2 method may be restricted by changing its default public scope.
