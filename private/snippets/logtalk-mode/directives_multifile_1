multifile(+qualified_predicate_indicator_term)
multifile(+qualified_non_terminal_indicator_term)

Description
Declares multifile predicates and multifile grammar rule non-terminals. In the case of object or category multifile predicates, the predicate (or non-terminal) must also have a scope directive in the object or category holding its primary declaration (i.e. the declaration without the Entity:: prefix). Entities holding multifile predicate primary declarations must be compiled and loaded prior to any entities contributing with clauses for the multifile predicates.

# prefix: :- multifile

:- multifile(${1:Functor/Arity}).
