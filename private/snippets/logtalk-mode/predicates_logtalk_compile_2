logtalk_compile(@source_file_name, @list(compiler_flag))
logtalk_compile(@list(source_file_name), @list(compiler_flag))

Description
Compiles to disk a  source file or a list of source files using a list of compiler flags. The Logtalk source file name extension (by default, .lgt) can be omitted. Source file paths can be absolute, relative to the current directory, or use library notation. This predicate can also be used to compile Prolog source files as Logtalk source code. When no recognized Logtalk or Prolog extension is specified, the compiler tries first to append a Logtalk source file extension and then a Prolog source file extension. If that fails, the compiler tries to use the file name as-is. Compiler flags are represented as flag(value). For a description of the available compiler flags, please consult the User Manual.
