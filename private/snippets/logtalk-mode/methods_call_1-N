Description
Calls a goal, which might be constructed by appending additional arguments to a closure. The upper limit for N depends on the upper limit for the arity of a compound term of the back-end Prolog compiler. This built-in meta-predicate is declared as a private method and thus cannot be used as a message to an object. The Closure argument can also be a lambda expression or a Logtalk control construct. When using a back-end Prolog compiler supporting a module system, calls in the format call(Module:Closure, Arg1, ...) may also be used.
