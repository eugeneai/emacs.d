context(--callable)

Description
Returns the execution context for a predicate call using the format logtalk(Call,ExecutionContext). Mainly used for providing a default error context when type-checking predicate arguments. The ExecutionContext should be regarded as an opaque term, which can be decoded using the logtalk::execution_context/7 predicate. Calls to this predicate are inlined at compilation time.
