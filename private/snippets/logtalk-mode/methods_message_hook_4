Description
User-defined hook method for intercepting printing of a message, declared in the logtalk built-in object as a public, multifile, and dynamic predicate. This hook method is automatically called by the print_message/3 method. When the call succeeds, the print_message/3 method assumes that the message have been successfully printed.
