Description
User-defined method for forwarding unknown messages sent to an object (using the ::/2 control construct), automatically called by the runtime when defined. This method is declared in the forwarding built-in protocol as a public predicate. Note that you can make its scope protected or private by using, respectively, protected or private implementation of the forwarding protocol.
