assertz(+clause)

Description
Asserts a clause as the last one for a dynamic predicate. When the predicate indicator for Head is declared in a uses/2 or use_module/2 directive, the clause is asserted in the referenced object or module. Otherwise the clause is asserted for an object's dynamic predicate. If the predicate is not previously declared (using a scope directive), then a dynamic predicate declaration is added to the object (assuming that we are asserting locally or that the compiler flag dynamic_declarations was set to allow when the object was created or compiled).
