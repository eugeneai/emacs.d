ask_question(+nonvar, +nonvar, +nonvar, +callable, -term)

Description
Built-in method for asking a question represented by a term, Question, which is converted to the question text using the logtalk::message_tokens(Question, Component) hook predicate. This method is declared in the logtalk built-in object as a public predicate. The default question prompt and the input stream used for each Kind-Component pair can be found using the logtalk::question_prompt_stream(Kind, Component, Prompt, Stream) hook predicate. The Check argument is a closure that is converted into a checking goal by extending it with the user supplied answer. This predicate implements a read-loop that terminates when the checking predicate succeeds.
