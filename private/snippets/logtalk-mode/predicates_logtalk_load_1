logtalk_load(@source_file_name)
logtalk_load(@list(source_file_name))

Description
Compiles to disk and then loads to memory a source file or a list of source files using the current default compiler flag values. The Logtalk source file name extension (by default, .lgt) can be omitted. Source file paths can be absolute, relative to the current directory, or use library notation. This predicate can also be used to compile Prolog source files as Logtalk source code. When no recognized Logtalk or Prolog extension is specified, the compiler tries first to append a Logtalk source file extension and then a Prolog source file extension. If that fails, the compiler tries to use the file name as-is.
