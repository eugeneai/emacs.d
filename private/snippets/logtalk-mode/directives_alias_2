Description
Declares predicate and grammar rule non-terminal aliases. A predicate (non-terminal) alias is an alternative name for a predicate (non-terminal) declared or defined in an extended protocol, an implemented protocol, an extended category, an imported category, an extended prototype, an instantiated class, or a specialized class. Predicate aliases may be used to solve conflicts between imported or inherited predicates. It may also be used to give a predicate (non-terminal) a name more appropriated in its usage context. This directive may be used in objects, protocols, and categories.
