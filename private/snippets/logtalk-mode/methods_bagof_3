Description
Collects a bag of solutions for the goal for each set of instantiations of the free variables in the goal. The order of the elements in the bag follows the order of the goal solutions. The free variables in the goal are the variables that occur in the goal but not in the template. Free variables can be ignored, however, by using the ^/2 existential qualifier. For example, if T is term containing all the free variables that we want to ignore, we can write T^Goal. Note that the term T can be written as V1^V2^....
