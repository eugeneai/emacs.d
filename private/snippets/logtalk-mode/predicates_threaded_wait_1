threaded_wait(?term)
threaded_wait(+list(term))

Description
Suspends the thread making the call until a notification is received that unifies with Term. The call must be made within the same object (this) containing the calls to the threaded_notify/1 predicate that will eventually send the notification. The argument may also be a list of notifications, [Term| Terms]. In this case, the thread making the call will suspend until all notifications in the list are received.
