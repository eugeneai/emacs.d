Description
Declares protected predicates, protected grammar rule non-terminals, and protected operators. A protected predicate can only be called from the object containing the directive or from an object that inherits the directive. A protected non-terminal can only be used as an argument in a phrase/2 and phrase/3 calls from the object containing the directive or from an object that inherits the directive. Protected operators are not inherited but declaring them provides useful information for defining descendant objects.
